                <p class="grid__main__body">Hello everybody, and welcome to my first post for quite a while. Today we
                    will be reviewing the Lost Thunder expansion and I will pick out what I think are the ten best
                    cards from the set.<span id="dots"> . .</span><span id="more" class="grid__main__body__more">
                        <h2 class="grid__main__header2">Hounourable Mentions</h2>
                        <p class="grid__main__body">Today I will have just one honourable mention. I don’t want to go
                            into a bunch of nearly equal Pokémon that I somehow have to fit in, so this will be a
                            single card spot. I couldn’t quite fit Mimikyu-GX into the top ten, so it will sit here.
                            Mimikyu has a very powerful attack that pairs extremely well with cards like Decidueye and
                            Giratina.</p>
                        <h2 class="grid__main__header2">10. Meganium</h2>
                        <p class="grid__main__body">This card has possibly my favourite ability in the game. Some
                            people might deny this card being very good, but I like my Stage 2 Pokémon, and this is one
                            of the greatest support cards for Stage 2 Pokémon there is. A simple 1-1 line of this in
                            any Stage 2 deck that runs Rare Candy will improve it tenfold.</p>
